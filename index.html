  <h1>Something I like - cycling</h1>

<p>I like cycling. It can be fast and fun. When I cycle at high speed, I feel like flying, seeing things flashing and moving fast toward my back side. It is very exciting. </p>

  <p>I can cycle fast to places far away, allow me to see many more things than walking, do more physical exercises than driving. I can pass through narrow paths and woods that cars cannot.</p>

  <p>It is convenient and simple to maintain a bike, only needing small space to store it, and little cost of keeping it operating. It costs little to own, maintain and repair a bike.</p>
    <h3>In all, I like cycling because it is:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>fast and exciting;</li>
  <li>convenient for travelling; and</li>
  <li>convenient for storage and maintenance.</li>
</ol>

  <li>driving,</li>
  <li>walking,</li>
  <li>running, or </li> <li>others? </li></ul>
